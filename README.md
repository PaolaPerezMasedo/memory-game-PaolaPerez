# Memory Game Project


## Project Rubric / Description

This is the third project from the Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree Scholarship.

The starter project that was provided by Udacity included some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but  primarily the JavaScript file.
I was provided as well with a "shuffle function" to shuffle the deck of cards.

## Version
 1st version 29/05/2018

## How to play?
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The player has to find all the pairs by clicking on the cards. Once one card is clicked the timer will start and the moves will be count. The game has to be finished before the three stars (lives) are over. If the player does not finish before all the lives are gone, a "game over" alert will appear. If the game is finish correctly  a pop up with the information of the game performance will show.

## How can I play?
You can click  here file:///C:/Users/Paola%20TesoritoLi/fend-project-memory-game/index.html to start playing 


## Game functionality
 This game includes:
 - Timer
 - Moves counter
 - Stars rating
 - Game Over modal
 - Congratulations modal with the timing, number of moves and stars
 - How to play modal with the instructions of the game
 - Restart button

## Usability
  The game is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and  desktop browsers.

## Known problems
  There is a bug in the function for the "how to play modal". Because it is needed to click twice
  in the "how to play" button in order to make it work.
  I think there must be some kind of whitespace.
